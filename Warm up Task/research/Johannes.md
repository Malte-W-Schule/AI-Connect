The first nationwide study on the impact of generative AI on visual arts reveals a divided picture:

About 42% of artists already use AI tools, mainly for idea generation (50%) and creating new works (39%). 43% see the greatest potential in entirely new art forms and techniques.
64% of art recipients are interested in AI-supported or fully AI-generated artworks; overall, 47% view AI’s role positively.
Major concerns: 56% of artists fear loss of income sources, 53% worry about their livelihoods, and 55% expect stronger competition from cheap AI content. A core problem is the unconsented use of artists’ works for training AI models.
By 2030, AI image generators could generate around 2 billion EUR annually in the country, largely based on artists’ training data.
Clear demands: 87% want mandatory consent and 91% demand financial compensation when works are used for training. 85% of artists and 83% of recipients support compulsory labeling of AI-generated art.
The study calls for ongoing monitoring, better media literacy, and legal remuneration rights or licensing models, in line with emerging EU regulations.

In short: AI is seen as a creative opportunity but primarily as an economic threat that requires swift political and educational responses.
