german study about risks in ai:

Demand for Consent (Opt-in): Over 90% of surveyed artists insist that AI companies must obtain prior permission before using copyrighted works for training. The current "Opt-out" process is rejected as insufficient.
Fear of Income Loss: There is massive concern that the market will be flooded with AI-generated images replacing human work and driving down fees.
Theft of "Artistic Signature": Artists fear that AI analyzes and mimics their individual style, thereby devaluing their unique identity and market value.
Lack of Transparency: A central criticism is that tech companies often conceal exactly which specific image data was used to train their models ("Black Box").
Demand for Compensation: There is a demand that the use of creative works as "raw material" for AI be financially compensated, similar to licensing models.
