german study about risks in ai:

Demand for Consent (Opt-in): Over 90% of surveyed artists insist that AI companies must obtain prior permission before using copyrighted works for training. The current "Opt-out" process is rejected as insufficient.
Fear of Income Loss: There is massive concern that the market will be flooded with AI-generated images replacing human work and driving down fees.
Theft of "Artistic Signature": Artists fear that AI analyzes and mimics their individual style, thereby devaluing their unique identity and market value.
Lack of Transparency: A central criticism is that tech companies often conceal exactly which specific image data was used to train their models ("Black Box").
Demand for Compensation: There is a demand that the use of creative works as "raw material" for AI be financially compensated, similar to licensing models.

Another Article "critisizing" the unpaid use of images from real humans as training data

“However, the automation of story creation and distribution through artificial intelligence poses pronounced labor equality issues as corporations seek cost-benefits for creative content and content moderation on platforms. These AI systems have been trained on the un- or under-compensated labor of artists, journalists and everyday people, many of them underpaid labor outsourced by U.S.-based companies. These sources may not be representative of global culture or hold the ideals of equality and justice. Their automation poses severe risks for U.S. and global culture and politics. As the web evolves, there remain big questions as to whether equity is possible or if venture capital and the wealthy will buy up all digital intellectual property. Conglomeration among firms often leads to market manipulation, labor inequality and cultural representations that do not reflect changing demographics and attitudes. And there are also climate implications for many new technological developments, particularly concerning the use of energy and other material natural resources.”

Introduction and Overview
Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly impacted creative sectors since 2022.
Key breakthroughs include OpenAI’s GPT series (ChatGPT, GPT-4), Google’s Gemini, and Anthropic’s Claude models.
Foundation models are now central, capable of being adapted to a wide range of tasks.
Key AI Technologies
Transformers: The dominant architecture for NLP and vision tasks, enabling parallel processing and capturing global dependencies.
Large Language Models (LLMs): Trained on vast datasets to understand and generate human language; examples include GPT-4, LLaMA, and Claude 3.
Diffusion Models (DMs): The leading technology for image generation, offering stable training and high-quality outputs by reversing a noise-addition process.
Implicit Neural Representations (INRs): Neural networks (like NeRFs) that represent 3D scenes or images as continuous functions, useful for 3D reconstruction and compression.
Applications in Content Creation
Text & Scripts: AI assists in writing articles, scripts, and journalism, though long-form creative writing remains a challenge.
Audio & Music: Tools like Suno and Udio generate radio-quality music, while voice transfer technology can mimic specific speakers.
Images: Models like Stable Diffusion 3 and DALL-E 3 create high-quality images from text prompts; new tools allow for easier inpainting and editing.
Video: 2024 saw a boom in text-to-video generation with models like OpenAI’s Sora and Google’s Veo, though generating long, consistent clips remains difficult.
3D & VR/AR: AI accelerates the creation of 3D assets and environments (e.g., DreamGaussian), facilitating the growth of the Metaverse and digital twins.
Post-Production and Enhancement
Restoration: AI restores old or damaged footage, handling tasks like denoising, deblurring, and colorization simultaneously.
Super-Resolution: Generative models upscale images and video to higher resolutions (e.g., 4K) adding realistic details.
VFX & Editing: AI automates rotoscoping and allows for real-time manipulation of facial expressions in video (e.g., FacePoke).
Information Analysis and Understanding
Extraction: AI automates object detection, tracking, and segmentation (e.g., Segment Anything Model - SAM).
Recommendation: Generative retrieval and sentiment analysis help tailor content to specific audiences and improve search engines.
Compression and Quality Assessment
Compression: Neural codecs for image and video are outperforming traditional standards (like VVC) in efficiency, though computational complexity is high.
Quality Assessment: New AI models evaluate visual quality by mimicking human perception, often using LLMs to judge aesthetics.
Future Challenges and Ethics
Ethics: Concerns include the spread of deepfakes, copyright issues regarding training data, and potential job displacement.
Technical Limits: Current AI struggles with deep reasoning, planning, and hallucination (generating false information).
Adoption: Artists face challenges with the unpredictability of AI outputs and the need to integrate these tools into established creative workflows.
